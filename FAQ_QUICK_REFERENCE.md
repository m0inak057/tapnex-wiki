<!-- FAQ Schema for Rich Snippets -->
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
    "@context": "https://schema.org",
    "@type": "FAQPage",
    "mainEntity": [
        {
            "@type": "Question",
            "name": "Your question here?",
            "acceptedAnswer": {
                "@type": "Answer",
                "text": "Your comprehensive answer here (150-400 words recommended)."
            }
        }
    ]
}
</script>
```

**Placement:** Insert before `</head>` tag, after Article/Breadcrumb schemas

## Content Guidelines

### Questions
- ✅ Use natural language (how users actually search)
- ✅ End with question mark
- ✅ Focus on "what", "how", "why", "when", "which"
- ✅ Target "People Also Ask" queries
- ✅ Keep concise but complete (10-100 characters)

### Answers
- ✅ **Optimal length:** 150-400 words
- ✅ **Minimum:** 50 characters
- ✅ **Maximum:** 1000 characters (to avoid truncation)
- ✅ Be comprehensive and self-contained
- ✅ Use clear, authoritative language
- ✅ Include specific details, numbers, examples
- ✅ Answer the question directly in first sentence

### FAQ Set Structure
- **Recommended:** 5 questions per page
- **Minimum:** 3 questions
- **Maximum:** 10 questions

**Typical 5-Question Pattern:**
1. **Definition:** "What is X?"
2. **How-to:** "How does X work?" or "How to implement X?"
3. **Benefits:** "Why use X?" or "What are the advantages?"
4. **Practical:** "What tools/devices/requirements for X?"
5. **Advanced:** "When/where to use X?" or "Best practices?"

## Testing & Validation

### Google Rich Results Test
Test individual pages:
```
https://search.google.com/test/rich-results?url=YOUR_PAGE_URL
```

### Expected Results
✅ FAQPage detected  
✅ All required properties present  
✅ Eligible for rich results  
✅ No errors or warnings

### Manual Validation Checklist
- [ ] JSON-LD syntax is valid
- [ ] @context is "https://schema.org"
- [ ] @type is "FAQPage"
- [ ] mainEntity array exists
- [ ] Each question has @type "Question"
- [ ] Each answer has @type "Answer"
- [ ] Questions end with "?"
- [ ] Answers are 50+ characters
- [ ] Schema is in `<head>` section

---

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: FAQ not appearing in rich results
**Solutions:**
1. Verify schema validation passes
2. Check page is indexed in Search Console
3. Ensure content matches schema
4. Wait 2-4 weeks for Google to process
5. Verify no duplicate questions on same page

### Issue: Validation warnings
**Common warnings:**
- Answer too short → Add more detail (target 150-400 words)
- Answer too long → Condense (under 1000 characters)
- Question doesn't end with "?" → Add question mark
- Multiple FAQ schemas → Remove duplicates

### Issue: Schema not detected
**Solutions:**
1. Check JSON syntax (use JSON validator)
2. Verify script type: `application/ld+json`
3. Ensure proper HTML escaping
4. Check schema is in `<head>`, not `<body>`

## Best Practices

### Content Quality
1. **Answer real user questions** - Use Search Console, analytics data
2. **Be comprehensive** - Don't require click-through to understand
3. **Stay current** - Update annually or when industry changes
4. **Show expertise** - Demonstrate E-E-A-T signals
5. **Avoid duplication** - Each question should be unique across site

### Technical Excellence
1. **Validate regularly** - Run verification script monthly
2. **Monitor performance** - Track rich result appearances
3. **Keep updated** - Follow schema.org updates
4. **Test changes** - Use Rich Results Test before deploying
5. **Document updates** - Note changes and rationale

### SEO Strategy
1. **Target question keywords** - Optimize for "People Also Ask"
2. **Match user intent** - Align with search behavior
3. **Support voice search** - Use conversational language
4. **Build topic clusters** - Link related FAQ pages
5. **Track rankings** - Monitor question-based keyword positions

## Troubleshooting

### Script Errors

**Error: File not found**
```bash
# Solution: Check file path is correct
# Verify file exists: ls EVENT-MANAGEMENT/Event-budgeting/index.html
```

**Error: Invalid JSON**
```bash
# Solution: Validate JSON syntax
# Use online validator: https://jsonlint.com/
```

**Error: Permission denied**
```bash
# Solution: Check file permissions
# On Windows: Check file isn't read-only
# On Linux: chmod +w filename
```

### Validation Failures

**"Missing mainEntity array"**
→ Add mainEntity array with at least 1 question

**"Question doesn't end with '?'"**
→ Add question mark to question text

**"Answer too short"**
→ Expand answer to at least 50 characters

**"Invalid @type"**
→ Use exact values: "FAQPage", "Question", "Answer"
