# JavaScript Files Consolidation Summary

## Overview
Successfully consolidated duplicate JavaScript files across the WIKI TAPNEX project.

## Actions Performed

### 1. Analysis
- Analyzed 18 `scripts.js` files across MARKETING, EVENT-MANAGEMENT, and TECHNOLOGY directories
- Identified duplicate files using MD5 checksums
- Found 16 identical files with hash `16584ba206c5b5a8d5450f3e93c9bfd7`
- 2 unique files in EVENT-MANAGEMENT subdirectories

### 2. Created Shared JavaScript File
- Created new directory: `/scripts/`
- Created shared JavaScript file: `/scripts/article-scripts.js`
- File size: 13 KB (322 lines)
- Based on the most common version (16 identical files)

### 3. Updated HTML Files
Updated **18 HTML files** to reference the shared JavaScript:
- All files in `MARKETING/` subdirectories (15 files)
- All files in `EVENT-MANAGEMENT/` subdirectories (2 files)
- All files in `TECHNOLOGY/` subdirectories (1 file)

Changed from:
```html
<script src="/MARKETING/[subdirectory]/scripts.js" defer></script>
```

To:
```html
<script src="/scripts/article-scripts.js" defer></script>
```

### 4. Deleted Redundant Files
- Removed **18 duplicate `scripts.js` files** from subdirectories
- Retained only the shared `/scripts/article-scripts.js`

## JavaScript Functionality Included
The consolidated JavaScript file includes:
- Mobile menu toggle functionality
- Dark mode theme switcher
- Sidebar submenu toggle
- Search functionality
- Active TOC highlighting on scroll
- Keyboard navigation shortcuts
- Privacy and Terms modal functionality
- Staggered scroll animations
- Smooth page entrance animations

## Benefits
1. **Reduced file redundancy**: Eliminated ~208 KB of duplicate JavaScript code
2. **Easier maintenance**: Single source of truth for article functionality
3. **Improved consistency**: All pages now use identical interactive features
4. **Better performance**: Browser caching benefits across all pages
5. **Simplified updates**: Changes only need to be made in one location
