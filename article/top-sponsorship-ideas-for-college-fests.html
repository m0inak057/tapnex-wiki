<h2>The Secret to Securing College Fest Sponsorships</h2>
<h3>Understanding the Concept of Brand Solutions</h3>

College fests are an exciting time for students, with youthful energy and a sense of camaraderie in the air. As a member of the marketing and sponsorship department, securing sponsorships can be a daunting task. However, with the right approach, you can win over sponsors and make your college fest a success. In this article, we'll explore the concept of brand solutions and how to apply it to your college fest sponsorship pitches.

<h3>The Problem with Current Sponsorship Pitches</h3>

Most marketing teams focus on the medium or media, rather than the concept. They create benefit sheets that list various touch-points, such as banners, standees, and social media, without taking into account the needs and objectives of the potential sponsor. This approach may get you some sponsorships, but it's not sustainable in the long run. You need to think concept first, execution second.

<h3>What is Concept First, Execution Second?</h3>

Concept first, execution second is a three-step approach that involves:

1. **Researching the potential brand's products, services, and campaigns**: Understand the brand's positioning, target audience, and marketing objectives.
2. **Analyzing the brand's advertising communication**: Decode the central message and positioning of the brand over time.
3. **Coming up with solutions that meet the brand's needs**: Create a campaign that addresses the brand's objectives and promotes its products or services.

<h3>An Example: Zoom Car and Advertising and Marketing Circle</h3>

Let's say you're a member of Advertising and Marketing Circle, a college association that promotes the field of marketing and communications. You've identified Zoom Car as a potential sponsor, but you don't just want to pitch a generic benefit sheet. Instead, you come up with a campaign that positions travelling and exploration as a great way to come up with insights for ads.

<h4>Step 1: Research and Analysis</h4>

You research Zoom Car's products and services, and analyze their advertising communication. You discover that Zoom Car promotes the idea of travelling and exploration, and that their target audience is mostly the youth who want to rent a car for a day-out with friends.

<h4>Step 2: Concept Creation</h4>

You create a campaign that positions travelling and exploration as a great way to come up with insights for ads. You tell Zoom Car that you can help them increase brand awareness and reach a target audience that aligns with their marketing objectives. This aligns with Advertising and Marketing Circle's own positioning, promoting the field of marketing and communications.

<h4>Step 3: Execution</h4>

You plan a media-mix that includes banners, standees, social media, and a stall at the college fest. The stall will guide people about Zoom Car and communicate the positioning through an activation around the stall. At the same time, Advertising and Marketing Circle is promoting its own cause of inspiring people to create ads.

<h3>The Benefits of Concept First, Execution Second</h3>

By taking a concept first, execution second approach, you can:

* Create a unique and compelling pitch that sets you apart from other colleges
* Align your marketing efforts with the brand's objectives and positioning
* Increase brand awareness and reach a target audience that aligns with the brand's marketing objectives
* Build a long-term relationship with the sponsor, increasing the chances of renewing the partnership in the future

<h3>The Human Connection</h3>

When dealing with prospective sponsors, remember that they're human beings first and marketing managers later. Human beings are creatures of emotion, not creatures of pure logic. When you walk an extra mile to understand their needs and objectives, and come up with solutions that meet those needs, you'll build a stronger connection with the sponsor.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

Securing college fest sponsorships requires more than just a generic benefit sheet. It requires a deep understanding of the potential sponsor's needs and objectives, and coming up with solutions that meet those needs. By applying the concept first, execution second approach, you can create a unique and compelling pitch that sets you apart from other colleges, and builds a long-term relationship with the sponsor. Remember to think concept first, execution second, and you'll be well on your way to securing sponsorships and making your college fest a success.
