# Dropdown Scroll Functionality Implementation

## Summary
Added scroll functionality to dropdown menus that contain more than 6 items, with visual scroll indicators.

## Changes Made

### 1. CSS Updates (`home.css`)

#### Desktop Dropdown Scrolling
- Added `max-height: 400px` to `.dropdown-menu` to limit dropdown height
- Added `overflow-y: auto` to enable vertical scrolling
- Added `scroll-behavior: smooth` for smooth scrolling experience

#### Custom Scrollbar Styling
- Styled the scrollbar with 8px width
- Added custom scrollbar track with subtle background
- Created custom scrollbar thumb with brand color (`--sidebar-highlight`)
- Added hover effect on scrollbar thumb

#### Scroll Indicator Gradient
- Added a gradient overlay at the bottom of scrollable dropdowns
- Gradient only appears when dropdown has more than 6 items (`has-scroll` class)
- Gradient fades out when user scrolls to the bottom (`scrolled-to-bottom` class)
- Gradient uses sticky positioning to stay at the bottom while scrolling

#### Mobile Responsive Updates
- Updated mobile dropdown `max-height` to 400px when open
- Added mobile-specific scrollbar styling (6px width for better mobile UX)
- Enabled `overflow-y: auto` for mobile dropdowns when open

#### Dark Theme Support
- Added dark theme scrollbar styling with lighter blue colors
- Updated gradient overlay to match dark theme card background
- Ensured consistent visual appearance in dark mode

### 2. JavaScript Updates (`home.js`)

#### New Function: `initDropdownScrollIndicators()`
- Automatically detects dropdown menus with more than 6 items
- Adds `has-scroll` class to menus that need scroll functionality
- Implements scroll event listener to track scroll position
- Adds/removes `scrolled-to-bottom` class based on scroll position
- This enables the gradient indicator to show/hide appropriately

#### Implementation
- Function is called on page load via `DOMContentLoaded`
- Works with existing dropdown toggle functionality
- No conflicts with mobile navigation or theme switching

## Visual Features

### For Users:
1. **Smooth Scrolling**: When dropdowns have many items, users can smoothly scroll through them
2. **Visual Indicator**: A subtle gradient at the bottom indicates more content below
3. **Custom Scrollbar**: Branded scrollbar that matches the site's design
4. **Responsive**: Works on both desktop and mobile devices
5. **Automatic Detection**: Only appears on dropdowns with more than 6 items

### Example:
- **Event Management** dropdown (3 items): No scroll needed
- **Technology** dropdown (5 items): No scroll needed  
- **Marketing** dropdown (15 items): **Scrolling enabled with indicator**

## Browser Compatibility
- Works in all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Scrollbar styling uses `-webkit-scrollbar` which works in Chromium-based browsers
- Firefox and other browsers will use default scrollbars
- Gradient indicator works in all modern browsers

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test on desktop with mouse wheel scrolling
2. Test on mobile with touch scrolling
3. Verify gradient indicator appears/disappears correctly
4. Check dark theme appearance
5. Verify existing dropdown toggle functionality still works
6. Test with dropdowns that have exactly 6 items (should not show scroll)
7. Test with dropdowns that have more than 6 items (should show scroll)

## Future Enhancements (Optional)
- Add keyboard navigation improvements (Page Up/Down support)
- Add scroll position memory when reopening dropdowns
- Add animation when gradient indicator appears/disappears
- Consider adding a "scroll to top" button for very long lists
