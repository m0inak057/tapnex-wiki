                <h2 id="ticketing-technologies">Ticketing Technologies</h2>
                <p>Modern digital ticketing encompasses multiple sophisticated methods, each designed for specific use cases and event types:</p>

                <h3>1. QR Code Tickets</h3>
                <p>QR Code tickets represent the most widespread and accessible form of digital ticketing.

                <p>Near Field Communication (NFC) technology is revolutionizing high-traffic events by enabling tap-to-enter access and lightning-fast crowd movement. This technology is particularly widespread at major festivals like NH7 Weekender and Sunburn in India, where thousands of attendees need seamless entry and re-entry capabilities.</p>

                <div class="technology-highlight">
                    <h4>Implementation Benefits:</h4>
