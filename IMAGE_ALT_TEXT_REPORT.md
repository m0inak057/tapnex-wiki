## Sample Images with Alt Text

### Sidebar Logo Images
```html
<img src="/images/TAPNEX_LOGO.png" alt="Tapnex Logo" class="sidebar-logo-image">
<img src="../images/TAPNEX_LOGO.png" alt="Tapnex Logo" class="sidebar-logo-image">
```

### Footer Logo Images
```html
<img src="/images/TAPNEX_LOGO.png" alt="Tapnex Wiki Logo" class="logo-image">
<img src="../images/TAPNEX_LOGO.png" alt="Tapnex Logo" class="logo-image">
```

### Header Logo Images
```html
<img src="images/TAPNEX_LOGO.png" alt="Tapnex Logo" class="header-logo">
```

## Alt Text Patterns Used

All images in the workspace use one of the following descriptive alt text values:

1. **"Tapnex Logo"** - Used for sidebar and header logos (most common)
2. **"Tapnex Wiki Logo"** - Used for footer logos in some pages

Both patterns are:
- âœ“ Descriptive and meaningful
- âœ“ Concise and clear
- âœ“ Appropriate for screen readers
- âœ“ Following accessibility best practices

## Image Usage Analysis

### Image Locations
All images reference the same logo file with different path formats:
- `/images/TAPNEX_LOGO.png` (absolute path)
- `../images/TAPNEX_LOGO.png` (relative path from subdirectories)
- `images/TAPNEX_LOGO.png` (relative path from root)

### Image Purposes
Images are used in two primary locations:
1. **Sidebar branding** - Logo in the navigation sidebar
2. **Footer branding** - Logo in the footer section

## Accessibility Compliance

### WCAG 2.1 Guidelines
âœ… **Level A - 1.1.1 Non-text Content**: All images have text alternatives that serve the equivalent purpose.

### Benefits
- Screen reader users can understand the purpose of each image
- Images are properly described for users with visual impairments
- SEO benefits from descriptive alt attributes
- Better user experience when images fail to load

## Recommendations

Since all images already have proper alt text, no immediate action is required. However, here are some best practices to maintain:

### For Future Image Additions

1. **Always include alt attribute**: Never create `<img>` tags without an alt attribute
2. **Make alt text descriptive**: Describe what the image shows, not just its filename
3. **Keep it concise**: Alt text should be brief but meaningful (typically under 125 characters)
4. **Context matters**: Consider the context in which the image appears
5. **Decorative images**: If an image is purely decorative, use `alt=""` (empty alt)
6. **Avoid redundancy**: Don't start with "Image of..." or "Picture of..."

### Quality Checklist for Alt Text
- [ ] Does it describe the image content or function?
- [ ] Is it appropriate for the context?
- [ ] Is it concise and clear?
- [ ] Would a screen reader user understand the image purpose?
- [ ] Does it avoid unnecessary phrases like "image of"?

## Validation Commands

To re-check images in the future, use these commands:

### Check for missing alt attributes
```bash
grep -rn '<img' --include="*.html" . | grep -v 'alt='
```

### Check for empty alt attributes
```bash
grep -rn 'alt=""' --include="*.html" .
```

### Count total images
```bash
grep -r '<img' --include="*.html" . | wc -l
```

### Count images with alt
```bash
grep -r '<img[^>]*alt=' --include="*.html" . | wc -l
```
