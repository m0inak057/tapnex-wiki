                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Range and Interaction:</strong> NFC has a very short range (under 10 cm) and requires an intentional, user-driven "tap." This makes it highly secure for transactions. RFID, in contrast, can operate up to 100 meters and is used for automatic, background scanning, such as tracking inventory in a warehouse.</li>
                        <li><strong>Communication Protocol:</strong> NFC is bi-directional, allowing two-way communication between devices. RFID is typically a one-way system where a reader retrieves data from a tag.</li>
                        <li><strong>Data Handling:</strong> An NFC reader communicates with one tag at a time, ensuring a focused and secure interaction. An RFID reader is designed to scan hundreds of tags simultaneously, making it ideal for logistics.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 id="security">Security Considerations and Vulnerabilities</h2>
                    <p>NFC's short operational range is its greatest security strength, as it makes remote hacking (eavesdropping) extremely difficult. Furthermore, modern NFC systems employ strong end-to-end encryption and tokenization to protect sensitive data during transactions. While theoretical vulnerabilities like relay attacks exist, they are difficult to execute in practice and can be mitigated with proper authentication protocols and time-sensitive transaction codes.</p>

                    <h2 id="wireless-charging">NFC Wireless Charging (WLC) Technology</h2>
                    <p>A newer and exciting development is NFC Wireless Charging (WLC). This specification allows for wireless power transfer of up to 1W (or 3W in some proprietary solutions) over a distance of up to 2 cm. This technology is perfectly suited for small, battery-powered devices like wearables, smart cards, and digital styluses, where larger Qi charging coils are impractical. The NFC wireless charging market is projected to grow rapidly, driven by the demand for smaller and more efficient charging solutions.</p>

                    <h2 id="future-trends">Future Trends and Technological Developments</h2>
                    <p>The future of NFC is bright, with its role expanding deeper into the Internet of Things (IoT) for seamless device commissioning and management. It is also being explored for autonomous vehicle communication (V2X) and in advanced healthcare solutions, such as powering implantable medical devices.
