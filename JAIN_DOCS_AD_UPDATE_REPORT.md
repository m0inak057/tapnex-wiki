## Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Ad Approval Time:** New ad placements may take some time to be reviewed by Google AdSense.

üìä **Performance Monitoring:** Monitor your AdSense dashboard over the next few days to compare performance with the old multiplex ads.

üîç **Test Mode:** If ads don't appear immediately, this is normal. Google AdSense needs time to:
- Index the new ad placements
- Review the content
- Match appropriate ads to your pages
