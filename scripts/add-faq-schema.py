                    'question': 'Is 5G safe? What about radiation concerns?',
                    'answer': '5G is safe according to major health organizations including the WHO, FDA, and FCC. 5G uses non-ionizing radio frequency radiation, which does not damage DNA or cells like ionizing radiation (X-rays). The frequencies used (sub-6 GHz and 24-100 GHz) have been extensively tested. 5G operates within established safety limits, and millimeter waves cannot penetrate skin deeply. Thousands of studies show no adverse health effects from RF exposure within regulatory limits.'

                    'question': 'What is an API and how does it work?',
                    'answer': 'An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. APIs work by defining endpoints (URLs), methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), and data formats (usually JSON or XML) for requests and responses. When you make an API call, your application sends a request to a server, the server processes it, and returns a response with the requested data or confirmation of an action.'

                    'question': 'What is the difference between REST and GraphQL APIs?',
                    'answer': 'REST APIs use multiple endpoints for different resources, return fixed data structures, and may require multiple requests for related data (over-fetching or under-fetching issues). GraphQL uses a single endpoint, allows clients to request exactly the data they need with flexible queries, returns only requested fields (solving over/under-fetching), supports real-time subscriptions, and has a strongly-typed schema. REST is simpler and works well for CRUD operations, while GraphQL excels for complex data requirements and mobile applications.'

                {
                    'question': 'What are API rate limits and why do they matter?',
                    'answer': 'API rate limits restrict the number of requests a client can make within a time period (e.g., 100 requests per minute). They matter because they: 1) Prevent server overload and ensure fair usage, 2) Protect against DDoS attacks and abuse, 3) Control costs for API providers, 4) Maintain quality of service for all users. Common rate limiting strategies include: fixed window (simple but can have burst issues), sliding window (more accurate), token bucket (flexible), and leaky bucket (smooth traffic flow).'

                    'question': 'Should I learn frontend or backend development first?',
                    'answer': 'Start with frontend development for beginners because: 1) Immediate visual feedback helps learning, 2) HTML/CSS/JavaScript are fundamental for all web development, 3) Easier to understand and debug, 4) Can build complete projects independently. After mastering frontend basics, add backend skills to become full-stack. However, career goals matter: frontend for UI/UX focus, backend for data/logic focus, full-stack for complete applications. Most successful developers eventually learn both sides.'

                    'question': 'What is the difference between a framework and a library?',
                    'answer': 'A library is a collection of pre-written code you call when needed (you control the flow) - examples: jQuery, Lodash, Axios. A framework is a complete structure that calls your code (framework controls the flow) - examples: React, Angular, Django, Laravel. Key difference: "Inversion of Control" - libraries are tools you use, frameworks are foundations you build on. Frameworks are more opinionated with specific patterns, while libraries offer flexibility. Choose frameworks for structure and best practices, libraries for specific functionality.'

Calculate financial ROI: (Revenue - Event Costs) / Event Costs × 100 = ROI percentage. Example: Event costs $50,000, generates $75,000 in revenue = ($75K - $50K) / $50K × 100 = 50% ROI. Beyond financial ROI, measure: 1) Lead Generation - qualified leads × average deal value, 2) Brand Awareness - media impressions, social engagement, website traffic, 3) Customer Satisfaction - NPS scores, attendee feedback, 4) Sales Pipeline - influenced deals, sales velocity, 5) Strategic Goals - partnerships formed, market penetration. Use event software to track metrics. Aim for minimum 25% ROI for corporate events, higher for revenue-focused events.'
