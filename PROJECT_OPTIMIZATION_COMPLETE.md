## Overall Project Impact

### Quantifiable Improvements:
1. **File Reduction:** Eliminated 36 duplicate files (18 CSS + 18 JS)
2. **Storage Saved:** ~946 KB of redundant code removed
3. **Files Updated:** 18 HTML files across all directories
4. **Maintainability:** Single source of truth for article styles and functionality

### New Directory Structure:
```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ styles/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ article-styles.css (shared CSS for all articles)

â”œâ”€â”€ MARKETING/ (15 subdirectories - all using shared files)
â”œâ”€â”€ EVENT-MANAGEMENT/ (2 subdirectories - all using shared files)
â””â”€â”€ TECHNOLOGY/ (1 subdirectory - all using shared files)
```
